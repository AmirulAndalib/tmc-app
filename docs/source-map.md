# Source map

What each file owns, per crate. The shape and the rule behind it are in [architecture.md](architecture.md).

**`src-tauri/core/src/` — `tmc-core`**

| File | Owns |
| --- | --- |
| `api.rs` | HTTP. `api_base()` — compile-time, or `TMC_API_BASE` in a debug build. Never a setting |
| `auth.rs` | PKCE, device-grant state, in-memory access token |
| `secure.rs` | Keychain / Credential Manager / Secret Service, file fallback on mobile. Keyed per API base |
| `settings.rs` | App-local settings (`settings.json`), clamped on read |
| `updater.rs` | **Where app updates come from and which key they need.** Override → compiled → fallback |
| `anchor.rs` | **What a jail anchor may be.** Guards `gameDirs` /`downloadDir` |
| `canon.rs` | Resolving a path, in the spelling everything else uses. The one door to `canonicalize` |
| `crypto.rs` | The device key, and what it does and does not buy |
| `deeplink.rs` | The closed list of what a `tmc://` link may ask for |
| `logging.rs` | Append-only JSONL audit log + `audit!` macro |
| `net/addr.rs` | **The public-address guard.** Resolve once, connect to that |
| `net/transport.rs` | Bounded UDP/TCP exchanges — every read has a deadline and a cap |
| `net/reader.rs` | The non-panicking byte cursor every parser is built on |
| `net/ping.rs` | TCP connect timing, for games with no protocol |
| `net/latency.rs` | Rolling per-server history, bounded on both axes |
| `net/query/` | The game protocols — [live-queries.md](live-queries.md) |
| `plugins/manifest.rs` | The manifest format and its validation |
| `plugins/jail.rs` | **The path jail.** Called a jail, not a sandbox — [sandboxes.md](sandboxes.md#sandboxes-and-how-mods-reach-the-game) |
| `plugins/steps.rs` | The install/uninstall executor |
| `plugins/apps.rs` | Per-game rules: where mods go, how to launch, sandbox presets, where its settings live |
| `plugins/query.rs` | The declarative parser for Server Live Query plugins |
| `plugins/config.rs` | **A game's own settings files.** Listing, reading and replacing what its `config.json` declares |
| `plugins/theme.rs` | Theme token validation |
| `plugins/registry.rs` | Installed plugins, approvals, fingerprint drift, the signature gate |
| `plugins/signature.rs` | **Who vouched for a plugin.** Ed25519 over the canonical manifest, against the user's own trust store |
| `deploy/merge.rs` | The virtual tree: who wins each path, and what conflicts |
| `deploy/link.rs` | One syscall each, and the platform reason it might fail |
| `deploy/ledger.rs` | What landed, what it displaced, and how to undo both |
| `deploy/engine.rs` | Strategy selection, the diff against last time, placement |
| `library/db.rs` | The device's SQLite store — subscriptions, sandboxes, queue, RCON |
| `library/sync.rs` | Reconciling against the account, on a watermark |
| `library/install.rs` | Materialising one subscription into the main game folder |
| `library/sandbox.rs` | Sandboxes: environment, strategy, options, load order |
| `library/deploy.rs` | Staging a mod into a sandbox, then deploying the sandbox |
| `download/rate.rs` | The token bucket behind both bandwidth limits |
| `download/mod.rs` | The queue itself |
| `download/store.rs` | The queue, across a restart |
| `detect/steam.rs` | `libraryfolders.vdf`, then every `appmanifest_*.acf` |
| `detect/epic.rs` | Epic's `.item` manifests, and Heroic/Legendary on Linux |
| `detect/gog.rs` | Galaxy's SQLite, read-only and `immutable=1` |
| `detect/folders.rs` | Xbox, Ubisoft, EA, Battle.net, and a game's own hints |
| `detect/vdf.rs` | VDF KeyValues, bounded on every axis |
| `rcon/source.rs` | Source RCON, which many other servers also speak |
| `rcon/frostbite.rs` | Frostbite R-CON, with `login.hashed` |
| `rcon/store.rs` | Saved servers. Passwords encrypted; none of it leaves the device |
| `launch.rs` | The only place a launch is RESOLVED. Produces a plan; runs nothing |
| `games/` | **Games TMC publishes, installed here.** Resolve a build for THIS machine, download it through the queue, unpack it, keep it current, plan its launch |
| `version.rs` | Comparing two versions, in the one place that does it. `1.10.0` is after `1.9.0` |
| `session.rs` | **Games that are running.** Keeps the `Child`, times the session, captures its output. What can be known about a launch, and what cannot |
| `detect/walk.rs` | The bounded walk over folders the USER ticked, for what no launcher wrote down |
| `library/share.rs` | A sandbox as a pasteable code. Item ids, never files, and nothing about this machine |
| `local/metadata.rs` | **`tmc.json`** — what an archive claims about where it came from. A hint, never a permission |
| `local/store.rs` | Imported mods on disk: assembling one, laying it out under the game folder, moving it, removing it |
| `local/adopt.rs` | What is already in a game folder that the ledger, a subscription and a previous adoption cannot account for |
| `local/vault.rs` | Paths this process found, named from the webview by token. What that buys, and what it does not |
| `plugins/managers.rs` | **Another mod manager, read.** Where it keeps its mods, declaratively — the fourth plugin type |

**`src-tauri/usvfs/src/` — `tmc-usvfs`**

| File | Owns |
| --- | --- |
| `tree.rs` | The merged view: resolution, directory listings, case rules. Platform-independent, tested everywhere |
| `shm.rs` | The blob format, published atomically and parsed defensively — it is read inside a game |
| `hooks.rs` | IAT patching and the redirecting `CreateFileW`. Windows only |
| `inject.rs` | `CREATE_SUSPENDED` + `CreateRemoteThread(LoadLibraryW)`, and the quoting `CommandLineToArgvW` demands |

**`src-tauri/src/` — `tmc-app`**

| File | Owns |
| --- | --- |
| `lib.rs` | Builder, plugin registration, the command list |
| `commands/` | The whole IPC surface. Nothing privileged happens outside it |
| `commands/fs.rs` | Directory listing for the app's folder picker. Names only, never contents |
| `commands/sandbox.rs` | Sandboxes, staging, deploying. Never takes a directory |
| `commands/downloads.rs` | The queue. No command here takes a URL or a destination — `download_release` takes ids |
| `commands/detect.rs` | Scan, and separately apply. A scan configures nothing |
| `commands/rcon.rs` | Consoles. No command returns a password |
| `commands/library.rs` | Sync, install, uninstall, launch |
| `commands/play.rs` | The two ways a game starts that the SERVER resolves. Names IDS, never a loader URL or a connect link |
| `commands/games.rs` | Installing, updating and starting a TMC build. Names an APP ID — never a URL, never a path |
| `commands/config.rs` | The game-settings editor's three commands, behind one setting |
| `commands/sessions.rs` | What is running, what ran, and the log it printed |
| `commands/import.rs` | Dropped files, adopted folders, other managers. Names TOKENS, never paths |
| `spawn.rs` | The only place in the app that starts a process. Which mechanism is the PLAN's decision, not the caller's |
| `state.rs` | `AppState`, assembled once — shared locks and caches depend on that |
| `paths.rs` | Every path, from Tauri's resolver — never `$HOME` |

**`src/`**

| Path | Owns |
| --- | --- |
