# Settings and logging

## Settings: the two halves

| | App settings | Account settings |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Stored | `settings.json`, this machine | `UserSettings` on the website |
| Written by | `settings.rs` | `PATCH /api/app/v1/me` |
| Read by | `useSettings().app` | `useSettings().user` |
| Contains | Theme, scale, game directories, logging, latency, download limits, plugin prompts | Notifications, locale, timezone |
| Can fail | No | Yes — network, auth |

The test for which side something belongs on: **would this be wrong to apply on a different machine?** A game directory would be. A notification preference would not.

### Two of them are not settings at all

`gameDirs` and `downloadDir` anchor the plugin jail — `plugins::jail` resolves every `PathRef` beneath them, so an installer holding `{gameDir, "", write}` can write anywhere below. They are therefore the only fields with their own commands:

- **`settings_patch` refuses them** (`JAIL_ROOT_FIELDS`), loudly rather than by dropping the key. The refusal is in `SettingsStore::patch`, so it holds for every caller and not just the one command.
- **`settings_set_game_dir` /`settings_set_download_dir`** run `anchor::validate_root`, which rejects a drive root, a system directory, and anything that *contains* the app's data, logs, cache, plugins or the user's home. A jail anchored above the app's own files would enclose `settings.json` and the plugin registry — a plugin that can rewrite the registry can grant itself permissions.
- The **canonical** path is what gets stored and what gets audited, so the value in `settings.json` is the one the jail will resolve to later.
- **A sandbox's own `gameDir` goes through the same validator**, on `sandbox_patch`. It gets no more trust for having arrived on a different command.
- Both are audited at **Security** level, so turning logging off cannot hide a change to where plugins may write.

What this does *not* establish is that a human chose the path. That came from the OS dialog and is gone with it; the anchor's **identity** is what is checked now, not its provenance. `anchor.rs`'s header says so plainly — don't let a later comment upgrade the claim.

## Logging

`Settings → Logging` reads an append-only JSONL audit trail. It is a **record of what the app did on the user's behalf**, not diagnostics — `tracing` handles those and goes to stderr.

- `Security` level entries are written **even when the user turns logging off**. A switch that lets a plugin ask the user to stop watching is not a control.
- Clearing the log writes the "log cleared" entry **after** the truncation.
- Every plugin step, every download URL, every jail refusal, every permission grant lands here.

Write with the `audit!` macro. Never put a token or a credential in `data`.
